How It Works -

We are a platform which enhances the peer to peer rental experiance --

In the everyday rising prices , Lending and sharing is a good way to save money and enjoy different experiences easily . 
SMORentel brings you a platform where you can easily rent . 

Lender Posts a product in the inventory after setting up an account .

Borrower takes the advantage of our search system to find a product specific to their need and time .
After a Borrower makes a request to borrow an item , request needs to be Approved by the Lender .

Once Lender approves the request , Borrower can pick up the product from him/her. 

*There are guidlines to lend an item please refer to that for safe lending . >> Link to safe lending  

After the Borrow is done using the item for the specified time , the item has to be returned to the owner/Lender.
